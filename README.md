## COMP 598 - Applied Machine Learning - Final project: Machine Learning for Improving Healthcare

The goal of this project is to investigate healthcare data.
We began by identifying an interesting prediction question that can be tackled using machine learning methods.
The problem decided was: predict the motor and total UPDRS scores for people with early-stage Parkinson's disease (cf: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons+Telemonitoring)
We then solved the problem using appropriate machine learning algorithms and methodology.
